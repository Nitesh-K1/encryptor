steganography:
each pixel has 3 values R, G, B >> Red >> Green >> Blue
(120, 200, 15)
each number(0-255) is stored in 8 bits
LSB >> steganography
example: let say we have  origina R values : 120 = 01111000
last bit - 0
now if we want to hide the message then
change the last bit to 1 >> 01111001 (which is 121)
by repeating many times we can hide the whole message

let say we have message  ""Hi" 
H = 72 so in binary > 01001000
i = 105 binary > 01101001
now 'Hi' becomes 01001000 01101001
